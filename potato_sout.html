    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This potato soup cooks in an Instant Pot® and is customizable with assorted toppings. I prefer to get my saltiness from the bacon, so I don't add extra salt. I also like a thicker chowder-like consistency; if you like yours thinner, add more liquid.

    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>4 thick slices cherrywood-smoked bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 ½ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup water
        </li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons garlic base (such as Better Than Bouillon® Roasted Garlic Base)
        </li>
        <li>1 ½ cups half-and-half
        </li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
        </li>
        <li>¼ cup sliced green onions
        </li>
        <li>
            ground black pepper to taste
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add onion, bacon, and butter to the hot pot and saute until bacon is crispy, 5 to 8 minutes. Turn off Saute function and transfer contents to a small bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Add potatoes, water, and garlic base to pot and close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 12 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
        </li>
        <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 15 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Mash potatoes against the side of the pot, leaving some chunks if desired. Add onion-bacon mixture and half-and-half; stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Ladle into soup bowls and top with green onions, Cheddar cheese, and black pepper.
        </li>
    </ol>
