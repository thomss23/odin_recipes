    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Creamy risotto with softened mushrooms and a sprinkling of cheese seems like a dish best ordered at a restaurant instead of made at home. That's because traditionally risotto is made slowly, stirring often, adding 1/4 cup of hot stock at a time, then more stirring. It's a labor-intensive dish that's worth the fuss. However, risotto made in a pressure cooker is so simple and quick that it feels like cheating. It's not. This is the real stuff. You'll probably start making risotto far more often after you try this one.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cups diced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 sprig rosemary</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</li>
        <li>3/4 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1 quart chicken stock</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Select the Saute function on an electric pressure cooker (such as Instant PotÂ®). Add butter and olive oil; stir until butter melts, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in onion; cook for 2 minutes. Add rosemary sprig; cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir rice into the pot until each grain is coated with butter-olive oil mixture, about 2 minutes. Pour in wine; simmer for 3 minutes. Pour in chicken stock, stirring to scrape the sides of the pot. Simmer for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>Close and lock the lid. Turn the venting knob to sealing. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 6 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
        </li>
        <li>Tap venting knob a few times with a wooden spoon or spatula. Stand back; turn knob to point at Vent. Remove lid when pressure is released, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Stir risotto until creamy, about 1 minute. Discard rosemary sprig. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in Parmesan cheese until melted and combined.
        </li>
    </ol>
